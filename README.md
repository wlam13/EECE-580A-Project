# EECE-580A-Project

Project for EECE-580A for Cyber Physical Security Systems.

This project is an in depth review based on the paper Side-Channel Inference Attacks on Mobile Keypads Using Smartwatches by Anindya Maiti, Murtuza Jadliwala, Jibo He, and Igor Bilogrevic. The paper covers side-channel attacks vulnerabilities on smart phones. Specifically the side channel attacks used are keystroke inference attacks on smartphone touchpads with a smart watch motion sensor. 

The Result Spreadsheet file is a combination of results from the original paper all into one spreadsheet created by myself.  

The (RAW) In-Depth Project Review.pdf file is an initial overall summerized review with in-depth review comments on the original paper. This an unrefined version of the final report since it reviews the entire project in great detail, even minute details. This paper was written before a page limit was determined for the project report. Therefore this file covers everything about the original paper in extreme detail as well as any and all accompanying comments. 

The Final Project Report.pdf is a refined version of the (RAW) In-Depth Project Review.pdf condensed down into 6 pages. The original project review file is 18 pages in length. The Final Project Report.pdf covers the most critical topics and comments from the (RAW) In-Depth Project Review.pdf file.
